notes covering pseudo-random range of cs terms,    
thrown on a pile. spontaneous clustering of   
related taxa into sensible organizational   
categories still unobserved. extra    
purpose: curb complexity    
by constructing   
deeply nested   
hierarchical   
collapsible   
non-repeating   
highly granular   
taxonomy/outline    
of terms and topics.    
temporary status record:    
hierarchy vs anarchy, zero nil;    
no clear winner on either side insofar.
