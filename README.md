notes    
covering     
pseudo-random     
range of cs terms,    
thrown in a pile.    
spontaneous clustering of     
related taxa into sensible     
and organizational   
categories still   
unobserved.   
extra purpose:    
curbing complexity    
by constructing   
deeply nested   
hierarchical   
collapsible   
non-repeating   
highly granular   
taxonomy/outline    
of terms and topics.    
contemporary status report:    
hierarchy vs anarchy: zero nil;    
no clear winner on either side.    
mapping text into context    
science into computer.   
no way to fail   
in a novel way.   
good science     
bad outline     
ok computer.
