δὲ τέχνη μακρή    
__CS DEBRIEF__    
*cs: digested*    
*& excerpted*     

FEATURING futile attempts to make an all encompassing, top to bottom, hierarchy of topics, with identified grandparent/parent/child relations among all pages/articles, so one can get at least some navigation idea in the huge CS corpus, akin to "you are at x. top is y, next is z".
