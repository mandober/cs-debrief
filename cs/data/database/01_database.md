# Databases

A **database** (DB) is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.

**Database system** consists of db-related elements, including the DB engine, DBMS, DB services and utilities.

**Relational database** (RDB), dominant DB model since the 1980s, models data in rows and columns inside tables, using an SQL dialect for data management.

**Non-relational database** systems, emerging in 2000s, lack a data model, storing data in loosely structured documents and manipulating it without employing a strict query language like SQL, therefore earning the name **NoSQL**.

**Database Management System** (DBMS) is a program that provides interaction and administration of the database.



**Data Query Languages** (DQL) are used to make queries in databases and information systems (IS).

**Structured Query Language** (SQL) is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).


**Information system** (IS) is a formal, sociotechnical, organizational systems designed to manage information. It has 4 components: technology, process, people and organizational structure. **Computer Information System** (CIS) is a software that runs a database (1); computer system supporting the db (2); system of people and computers that processes or interprets information (3).
