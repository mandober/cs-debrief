### 4.5.6.2 Analogue and digital
Analogue data has a range of values, but digital only has two states. This is shown in electronic circuits, where analogue circuits can use any voltage within the operating range, e.g. 0-12V, to indicate a value, e.g. the amount of rain in a rain sensor. Digital circuits, however, can only use two different values, called logical high and logical low. These values correspond to 1 and 0 in binary, and these states are switched between many times per second to transfer data and to perform operations on data.

Digital data is usually composed of sequences of binary values, and analogue data is usually represented as waves, or sequences of continuous decimal values. Digital and analogue signals are snapshots of these sequences at a specific time point.
