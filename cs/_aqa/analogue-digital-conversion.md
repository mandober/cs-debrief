### 4.5.6.3 Analogue/digital conversion
#### ADCs and DACs
Analogue to digital converters take samples of the wave at specific times, and then output them as sequences of digital values. This allows sound (and other analogue data) to be stored and edited digitally. It is also very easy to copy these digital values without any loss in quality.

Digital to analogue converters often use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to approximate the shape of analogue waves using a digital output by rapidly turning on and off. <!-- TODO what does the teach-ict actually say about this? -->

#### ADC usage
Analogue to digital converters are used to allow computers to read analogue values from sensors. This is because almost all values in the real world are analogue, e.g. light, sound, volume, length and pressure. Computers cannot read analogue values directly, so ADCs are required to convert them to a usable, digital, form.

They are also used in sound cards for microphone input, as sound is analogue.

#### DAC usage
The most common usage of digital to analogue converters is in sound cards. They are used to allow digitally stored audio to be reproduced in speakers or headphones, so the audio can be heard. The digitally stored audio is converted to analogue voltages, which are then passed to speakers which convert them into audible vibrations.
