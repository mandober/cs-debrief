# A quick method to judge a book 

If you need to judge a book quickly, but the cover is lacking or a slightly less unreliable method is desired, a desperately crude method may be used, based on the number of occurrences of the adverb "indeed".

It produces an absolute index, $$\sigma$$, which might as well be compared against a user-defined threshold scale; e.g. $$a \lt \sigma \le b$$, where $$a$$ and $$b$$ are judgements.

Further refinement reveals the index proper by taking the number of pages into account to allow for cross-publication comparison. The index proper, $$i$$, relates the number of pages, $$\eta$$, with the absolute index, $$\sigma$$.

$$
\displaystyle
i_{pp} = \frac{\sigma}{\eta}
$$
