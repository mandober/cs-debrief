# Database normalization

Database normalization is the process of structuring a relational database in accordance with a series of so-called *normal forms* in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity.

It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as an integral part of his relational model.

Normalization entails organizing the columns (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints.

It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of **synthesis** (creating a new database design) or **decomposition** (improving an existing database design).




The database community has developed a series of guidelines for ensuring that databases are normalized. These are referred to as normal forms, 1NF through 6NF. In practice, 1NF, 2NF and 3NF are the most frequent, while 5NF is rarely seen.



## Sixth normal form

**Sixth normal form** `6NF` is a term in relational database theory, used in two different ways.
