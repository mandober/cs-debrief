# Types of databases


* [Active database][47] 
includes an event driven architecture (often in the form of ECA rules) which can respond to conditions both inside and outside the database.
* [Animation database][48] 
stores fragments of animations or human movements and which can be accessed, analyzed and queried to develop and assemble new animations.
* [Back-end database][49] 
accessed by users indirectly through an external application rather than by application programming stored within the database itself or by low level manipulation of the data (e.
* [Bibliographic database][50]
database of bibliographic records, an organized digital collection of references to published literature, including journal and newspaper articles, conference proceedings, reports, government and legal publications, patents, books, etc.
* [Centralized database][51] 
database located and maintained in one location, unlike a distributed database.
* [Cloud database][52] 
runs on a cloud computing platform, such as Amazon EC2, GoGrid and Rackspace.
* [Collection database][53] 
collection catalog of a museum or archive implemented using a computerized database, in which the institution's objects or material are catalogued.
* [Collective Optimization Database][54] 
open repository to enable sharing of benchmarks, data sets and optimization cases from the community, provide web services and Plug-in (computing)|plugins to analyze optimization data and predict program transformations or better hardware designs for multi-objective optimizations based on statistical and machine learning techniques provided there is enough information collected in the repository from multiple users.
* [Configuration management database][55]
* [Cooperative database][56] 
holds information on customers and their transactions.
* [Correlation database][57] 
database management system (DBMS) that is data model independent and designed to efficiently handle unplanned, ad hoc queries in an analytical system environment.
* [Current database][58] 
conventional database that stores data that is valid now.
* [Directory][59] 
repository or database of information which is optimized for reading, under the assumption that data updates are very rare compared to data reads. Commonly, a directory supports search and browsing in addition to simple lookups.
* [Distributed database][60] 
database in which storage devices are not all attached to a common CPU.
* [Document-oriented database][61] 
computer program designed for storing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented, or Semi-structured model|semi structured data, information.
* [EDA database][62] 
database specialized for the purpose of electronic design automation.
* [Endgame tablebase][63] 
computerized database that contains precalculated exhaustive analysis of a chess endgame position.
* [Food composition database][64] (FCDB) 
provides detailed information on the nutritional composition of foods.
* [Full-text database][65] 
database that contains the complete text of books, dissertations, journals, magazines, newspapers or other kinds of textual documents. Also called a "complete-text database".
* [Government database][66] 
collects personal information for various reasons (mass surveillance, Schengen Information System in the European Union, social security, statistics, etc.).
* [Graph database][67] 
uses graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data.
* [Knowledge base][68] 
special kind of database for knowledge management. A knowledge base provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised.
* [Mobile database][69] 
can be connected to by a mobile computing device over a mobile network.
* [Navigational database][70] – database in which objects (or records) in it are found primarily by following references from other objects.
* [Non-native speech database][71] – speech database of non-native pronunciations of English.
* [Online database][72] – database accessible from a network, including from the Internet.
* [Operational database][73] – accessed by an Operational System to carry out regular operations of an organization.
* [Parallel database][74] – improves performance through parallelization of various operations, such as loading data, building indexes and evaluating queries.
* [Probabilistic database][75] – uncertain database in which the possible worlds have associated probabilities.
* [Real-time database][76] – processing system designed to handle workloads whose state is constantly changing (Buchmann).
* [Relational database][77] – collection of data items organized as a set of formally described tables from which data can be accessed easily.
* [Spatial database][78] – database that is optimized to store and query data that is related to objects in space, including points, lines and polygons.
* [Temporal database][79] – database with built-in time aspects, for example a temporal data model and a temporal version of Structured Query Language (SQL).
* [Time series database][80] – a time series is an associative array of numbers indexed by a datetime or a datetime range. These time series are often called profiles or curves, depending upon the market. A time series of stock prices might be called a price curve, or a time series of energy consumption might be called a load profile. Despite the disparate naming, the operations performed on them are sufficiently common as to demand special database treatment.
* [Triplestore][81] – purpose-built database for the storage and retrieval of triples, a triple being a data entity composed of subject-predicate-object, like "Bob is 35" or "Bob knows Fred".
* [Very large database][82] (VLDB) – contains an extremely high number of tuples (database rows), or occupies an extremely large physical filesystem storage space.
* [Virtual private database][83] (VPD) – masks data in a larger database so that security allows only the use of apparently private data.
* [Vulnerability database][84] – platform aimed at collecting, maintaining, and disseminating information about discovered vulnerabilities targeting real computer systems.
* [XLDB][85] – Stands for "eXtremely Large Data Base".
* [XML database][86] – data stored in XML format, where it can be queried, exported and serialized into the desired format.
