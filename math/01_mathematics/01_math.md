# Mathematics

**Mathematics** includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, change, seeking patterns that lead to the discovery of new knowledge with the truth deducible from the supplied proof, which relies on the rigorous argumentation.

Mathematical method, used to organize existing and discover new knowledge, starts with the primitive concepts and then introduces axioms, using them to derive new truth through rigorous argumentation.



The ancient greeks have championed *rigorous argumentation* and *axiomatic methods* for organizing a field of knowledge logically, starting with the primitive concepts and axioms as the building blocks for building theorems.

This method reached its peek with Euclid of Alexandria; his book `Elements` from ~300 BCE featured theorems, of what will later be known as the *Euclidean geometry*, that were all deduced from a small set of axioms. Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms, showcasing excellence in rigor that set the standard for the future.

> "Elements" is one of the all-time most influential works, having served as the geometry textbook from the time of publication until the early XX century.


The development of mathematics was going slow through the middle ages, until the Renaissance, when it exploded with new discoveries and innovations.

Late XIX century saw mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from a set of axioms and definitions. This prompted a German mathematician David Hilbert to propose a research into the foundations of mathematics.

The foundation of a mathematical field refers to an analysis of the most fundamental concepts within a field, an investigation into ways to turn that study into a coherent body of knowledge and integrate it with the rest of human knowledge. The **foundation of mathematics** can be regarded as the study of the basic mathematical concepts, especially the fundamental ones that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories, models, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.).

The search for the foundations of mathematics came about very late in the course of math development, at the end of the XIX century, when some aspects of math were found to suffer from paradoxes and inconsistencies.

In 1900, at the international conference in Paris, Hilbert showcased a collection of 23 mathematical problems, known as **Hilbert's program**, in connection with the search for foundations. Hilbert wanted to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, providing a proof that these axioms were consistent.

Hilbert's challenge was in response to the **foundational crisis of mathematics** that emerged at the turn of the century, as a consequence of discovered inconsistencies and paradoxes in prevailing mathematical theories.

The search for theory that will serve as the foundations of all math settled down during the XX century, putting forward a ZF set theory as the main pretender for this title. Recently, a new challenger in the form of category theory has emerged, drawing in significant support, but still, to this day, the champion is undecided (decidability as leitmotif). Even the turtles get weary.
