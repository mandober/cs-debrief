# Mathematics

**Mathematics** includes the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, change, seeking patterns that lead to the discovery of new knowledge with the truth deducible from the supplied proof, which relies on the rigorous argumentation.

**Mathematical method**, championed by the ancient greeks, is used to discover new and logically organize existing body of knowledge. It is a method employed to build a theory, based on *primitive concepts* and *axioms* as the building blocks, and *rigorous argumentation* for deriving steps toward the proof.

**Primitive notion** is a given, undefined concept that is to be taken for granted; it is not defined in terms of previously defined concepts. Sometimes the primitive notions cannot be avoided because we need to start somewhere. 
A primitive is analogous to an axiom in that it also doesn't require proof.

**Axioms** are statements taken to be true, serving as premises for further reasoning. The word comes from the Greek ἀξίωμα (axioma) "that which commends itself as evident". In philosophy an axiom is a statement that is so evident or well-established that it is accepted without controversy or question. In modern logic, an axiom is a premise or starting point for reasoning.

We start with the primitives and axioms, using them to derive new truth through rigorous argumentation.

Mathematical method reached its peek with Euclid of Alexandria; his book `Elements` from ~300 BCE featured theorems, of what will later be known as the *Euclidean geometry*, that were all deduced from a small set of axioms. Euclid justifies each proposition by a demonstration in the form of chains of syllogisms, showcasing excellence in rigor that set the standard for the future.

> "Elements" is one of the all-time most influential works, having served as the geometry textbook from the time of publication until the early XX century.

The development of mathematics was going slow through the middle ages, until the Renaissance, when it exploded with new discoveries and innovations.

Late XIX century saw mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from a set of axioms and definitions. This prompted a German mathematician David Hilbert to propose a research into the foundations of mathematics.

The foundation of a mathematical field refers to an analysis of the most fundamental concepts within a field, an investigation into ways to turn that study into a coherent body of knowledge and integrate it with the rest of human knowledge. The **foundation of mathematics** can be regarded as the study of the basic mathematical concepts, especially the fundamental ones that form the language of mathematics (formulas, theories, models, definitions, proofs, algorithms, etc.).

The search for the foundations of mathematics came about very late in the course of math development, at the end of the XIX century, when some aspects of math were found to suffer from paradoxes and inconsistencies.

In 1900, at the international conference in Paris, Hilbert showcased a collection of 23 mathematical problems, known as **Hilbert's program**, in connection with the search for foundations. Hilbert wanted to ground all existing theories to a finite, complete set of axioms, providing a proof that these axioms were consistent.

Hilbert's challenge was in response to the **foundational crisis of mathematics** that emerged at the turn of the century, as a consequence of discovered inconsistencies and paradoxes in prevailing mathematical theories.

The search for theory that will serve as the foundations of all math settled down during the XX century, putting forward a ZF set theory. Recently, the comotion started again as the *Category theory* began to draw support as the new contendor for the title. Still, to this day the winner is undecided (undecidability as leitmotif).

~~When developing a new theory, you might start by defining a concept that's central to the theory. But then the terms used in the definition also have to be defined. And these terms too, forming an infinite chain. So you keep defining terms until you reach the low-level fabric of the existance, at which point you politely restrain yourself on the account of spacetime a) needed for proper deposition; b) wasted on trivial demonstration; c) discontinuation; a call upon intuitive understanding is presumed to supress rigorous argumentation when paired with authoritative use of the word "indeed".A solid line of reasoning should form where the higher concepts clearly follow (yes sequitur) from the terms below; sound complete consistent arguments that hold even in reference to the borderline cases from the edges of their domain. History warns the unsoundness of argument may provoke unsoundness of mind. The relief, inspired by the literaly device from ancient greek tragedies, was promptly put to practice - the theorists were granted a spell used to break the infinity (chain)!~~
