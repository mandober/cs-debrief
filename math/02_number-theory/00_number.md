# Number

A number is a mathematical primitive i.e. undefined concept without a physical manifestation, existing only in the mind, together with all the other mathematical constructs. Fortunately, we all intuitively understand the concept of a number alone, apart from its representation.

Numeral is the notational symbol that represents a number.

A representation of a number, that is its written representation (because spoken representations differ tremendously across languages), called a numeral, is a particular symbol used for its notation, just a "smudge on a paper" without inherent meaning.

The choice of a particular symbol used to represent a particular number is arbitrary; an Arabic set of symbols was agreed upon, so today's worldwide standard for written numeric representation came to be the set of symbols we're all familiar with. We could have as well ended up using a drastically different set of symbols; maybe soon, we can set up a simulation to mimic the development of a civilization and witness the other interesting outcomes.

Hand at hart, the Arabic symbols were not completely arbitrary: the number of angles in a symbol is supposed to represent that number. Zero has no angles; one must be written sans-serif. Generally, the required number of angles does emerge, provided a more "flattening" style that avoids curves and/or strategically placed serifs. Two is a sans-serif "Z"; 3 is a 90-degrees rotated W or M; the upper part of 4 must close a triangle; 5 as a flattened out 5 with a stalagmite; the same for 6, except it features a stalactite instead; 7 comes with two extra lines, bottom and middle; 8 has squared, digital clock style; 9 gets mutilated downstairs: after a steady growth, a stalagmite confuses directions taking a sharp turn right only to replace itself with a stalagmite.
