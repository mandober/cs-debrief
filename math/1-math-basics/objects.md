# Mathematical objects


**Mathematical object** is anything that can be *formally defined* and used in deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Common objects include, permutations, combinations, partitions, functions, relations, proofs, theorems. In modern formal treatments, most mathematical objects are *defined in terms of sets* (even though sets themselves are undefined).

**Mathematical space** is a universe (universal set) with some added structure. While modern mathematics uses many types of spaces, such as Euclidean spaces, linear spaces, topological spaces, Hilbert spaces, probability spaces, it doesn't define the notion of "space" itself.


A **set** is is an unordered collection of distinct mathematical objects that share a common property. Despite the fact that sets are the basis of mathematics, with nearly all mathematical objects resembling a set of some kind, the term "set" doesn't have a formal definition.

**Mathematical structure** on a set is an additional structural object that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set, endowing it with some extra meaning or significance. Structure-preserving relations map structures in domain to equivalent structures in codomain: **homomorphisms** preserve algebraic structures, **homeomorphisms** preserve topological structures, **diffeomorphisms** preserve differential structures.
