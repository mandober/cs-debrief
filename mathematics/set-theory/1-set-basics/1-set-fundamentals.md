## Sets
Sets were introduced by the German mathematician **Georg Cantor** at the end of the XIX century: _"A set is a gathering (into a whole) of definite, distinct objects (of our perception or thought), called the elements of the set."_ (loose translation, [^1])

Loosely, a set is a container object, it is a collection of (discrete and finite) objects; an object contained in a set is called a *set member* (or a set element).

## Set is undefined
A set is primitive, undefined notion. It escapes any attempt to formally define it and must be taken as a granted, intuitive notion.

- *Mary Tiles*:
The 'definition' of 'set' is less a definition than an attempt at explication of something which is being given the status of a primitive, undefined, term. As evidence, she quotes Felix Hausdorff
- *Felix Hausdorff*:
"A set is formed by the grouping together of single objects into a whole. A set is a plurality thought of as a unit."

- The empty set is a primitive notion. To assert that it exists would be an implicit axiom.

## Basic properties of sets
Considering the *ordering* and *uniqueness* of elements, there are 4 possible types of collections. A set is a collection of elements whose order within the set is inconsequential, but the uniqueness of elements is enforced - multiple instances of the same object are treated as a single object[^2].


- ordered collection with unique members
- ordered collection with repeatable (non-unique) members
- unordered collection unique
- unordered collection non-unique






[^1]: "Unter einer **Menge** verstehen wir jede Zusammenfassung *M* von bestimmten wohlunterschiedenen Objekten *m* unserer Anschauung oder unseres Denkens (welche die **Elemente** von *M* genannt werden) zu einem Ganzen."   
By a Set we mean any summary M of certain well-differentiated Objects of our Intuition or our Thinking (which are named the Elements of M) into a Whole.

[^2]: Some authors describe this in brief using a mathematical expression, such as {a,b} = {a,a,b,b} which, besides the intended meaning, may also encourage one to think it is allowed to produce additional instances of elements within a set.
